Are you ready for our journey to a more accessible world? Let's get started!

## What is Accessibility?
Accessibility is defined as a "word used to describe whether a product can be used by people of all abilities.".

## What is Inclusion?
To be inclusive means to embrace disability from the very beginning: from the earliest planning stages of a product, to its launch, to its latest updates.  **Accessibility should always be built in rather than bolted on**. 

If accessibility is an afterthought, changes may be rushed or viewed as a low priority, which _could result in **people with disabilities having an inferior experience and feeling excluded**_.

In this way, being inclusive can change what is possible for people with disabilities. It also helps public companies and organizations ensure they are doing their work with truly everyone in mind. At Microsoft, we believe there is no limit to what people can achieve when technology reflects the diversity of all who use it.

##   How is Web Accessibility defined?
It is a continuous effort to ensure that everything we create for the web can be used, interpreted, and operated by a wide range of people in a wide range of circumstances.

## Why accessibility is important for people of all abilities?
> Accessibility is important for people of all abilities and affects the way everyone uses technology.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) more than one billion people worldwide live with a disability. 

That's more than 15 percent of our global population! In fact, as of 2020, 22 percent of the world's population is over 60 years old---this is noteworthy because, as people age, they may experience changes in their abilities. 

Additionally, each of us may encounter temporary disabilities at some point throughout our everyday lives. For example, if you fracture a finger, you may be limited in how much or how fast you can type. In this instance, Speech Recognition could help you to continue to use your computer and stay productive. People also frequently experience situational exclusion, which means a given circumstance or activity affects their ability to perform a task.

    - LATAM has 55% of countries with laws, standards, or guidelines that specifically address web accessibility.
