# What is Azure?

> If you still don't have your Azure Account, please [see the Create an Azure account learning module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account/).

In this module we are going to learn about:
- Azure
- What can I do with Azure?
- What are public, private and hybrid cloud?
- Cloud model comparasion
- Azure Portal
- Azure Marketplace
- Azure Services
- What does it include de Azure Free Account?
- What is the Azure free student account?
- What is the Learn sandbox?

Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

##  What can I do with Azure?
Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines, to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in Azure. Migrating your existing apps to virtual machines is a good start, but the cloud is much more than a different place to run your virtual machines.

## What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?
There are three deployment models for cloud computing: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud. Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud.

| Deployment model | Description
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| Public cloud   | Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet|
| Private cloud   | A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. |
| Hybrid cloud   | A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.|


## Cloud model comparison
Public cloud
- No capital expenditures to scale up.
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
- Organizations pay only for what they use.

Private cloud
- Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
- Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
- Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.

Hybrid cloud
- Provides the most flexibility.
- Organizations determine where to run their applications.
- Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.

## What is the Azure portal?
The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools. With the Azure portal, you can manage your Azure subscription by using a graphical user interface. You can:

Build, manage, and monitor everything from simple web apps to complex cloud deployments.
Create custom dashboards for an organized view of resources.
Configure accessibility options for an optimal experience.

The Azure portal is designed for resiliency and continuous availability. It maintains a presence in every Azure datacenter. This configuration makes the Azure portal resilient to individual datacenter failures and avoids network slowdowns by being close to users. The Azure portal updates continuously and requires no downtime for maintenance activities.

## What is Azure Marketplace?
Azure Marketplace helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services, which are optimized to run on Azure. Azure Marketplace customers can find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers. All solutions and services are certified to run on Azure.

The solution catalog spans several industry categories such as open-source container platforms, virtual machine images, databases, application build and deployment software, developer tools, threat detection, and blockchain. Using Azure Marketplace, you can provision end-to-end solutions quickly and reliably, hosted in your own Azure environment. At the time of writing, there are more than 8,000 listings.

## Azure Services
Let's take a closer look at the most commonly used categories:

- Compute
- Networking
- Storage
- Mobile
- Databases
- Web
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Big data
- AI
- DevOps

## What is the Azure free account?
The Azure free account includes:

- Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.
- A credit to spend for the first 30 days.
- Access to more than 25 products that are always free.
- The Azure free account is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore. To sign up, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account. The credit card information is used for identity verification only. You won't be charged for any services until you upgrade to a paid subscription.

## What is the Azure free student account?
The Azure free student account offer includes:

- Free access to certain Azure services for 12 months.
- A credit to use in the first 12 months.
- Free access to certain software developer tools.
- [The Azure free student account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) is an offer for students that gives $100 credit and free developer tools. Also, you can sign up without a credit card.

## What is the Learn sandbox?
Many of the Learn exercises use a technology called the sandbox, which creates a temporary subscription that's added to your Azure account. This temporary subscription allows you to create Azure resources for the duration of a Learn module. Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources for you after you've completed the module.

When you're completing a Learn module, you're welcome to use your personal subscription to complete the exercises in a module. The sandbox is the preferred method to use though, because it allows you to create and test Azure resources at no cost to you.
