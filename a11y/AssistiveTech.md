## What is disability?
Disability is defined as "a mismatch in interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live."

There are many different types of disabilities, including vision, hearing, speech, mobility, learning, and neurodiversity. How a person uses technology is dependent on a variety of factors including the person, their environment, and their goals. 

- For example, while one person with low vision may use Magnifier to access technology, another person may use Narrator. Other people may prefer tools like Quiet Hours and Focus Assist to better concentrate on a specific task. It all depends on the individual person and their needs and preferences.

# Assistive technology

People with limited visual or motor skills may benefit from assistive technology. With assistive technologies, we have alternatives to existing technologies to improve our ability to interact with the world around us and consume it.

Some people with disabilities may use assistive technology (AT) to access technology or perform tasks. AT is any item, piece of equipment, software program, or product that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities (ATIA)*. There is a wide variety of AT products and applications that enable people improve their ability to access technology.

There are two different types of assistive technologies for the web: those that support **visual skills** and those that support **motor skills**. 

- **Visual Skills**:
    - There are people who cannot use a screen as commonly as others.
        - *Screen readers*: are software you install on your computer that reads aloud web pages for people who have difficulty reading. 
        - *Extensions that manipulate CSS*. These extensions can manipulate the CSS of websites to make the focus bigger, change a specific color, enlarge the text, or change the style of the site to help a person decide what helps them better interpret a site.


- **Motor skills**:
    -  *Wand for mouth.* 
        - It can be used by people who are unable to use their hands to operate a keyboard or other assistive technology by inserting it into their mouth.
    - *Switch.*
        - With assistive technologies, simply giving a person the option of operating a switch that does the task of turning on or off, whether it is one button, two buttons, big buttons, or little buttons, opens up a whole new world of possibilities. It could be a sensor that detects when the face moves and that the person configures. 

You may now be wondering how assistive technologies work when they are used to improve motor skills. It is very important to pay attention to the keyboard as it is the link that will bring our website to the world of assistive technologies, so we need to make sure that we are using it correctly.

_Fun fact_: Microsoft Teams also has translation capability. The inline message translation feature allows users to translate Teams messages in the language specified in their personal language settings for Office 365.

Now you are ready to move on to the next module!
