# Assistive technology
Some people with disabilities may use assistive technology (AT) to access technology or perform tasks. AT is any item, piece of equipment, software program, or product that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities (ATIA)*. There is a wide variety of AT products and applications that enable people improve their ability to access technology.

## What is disability?
Disability is defined as "a mismatch in interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live."

There are many different types of disabilities, including vision, hearing, speech, mobility, learning, and neurodiversity. How a person uses technology is dependent on a variety of factors including the person, their environment, and their goals. 

- For example, while one person with low vision may use Magnifier to access technology, another person may use Narrator. Other people may prefer tools like Quiet Hours and Focus Assist to better concentrate on a specific task. It all depends on the individual person and their needs and preferences.

Microsoft Teams also has translation capability. The inline message translation feature allows users to translate Teams messages in the language specified in their personal language settings for Office 365 (image below). This way people from different backgrounds and with different abilities can all communicate and participate equally within a meeting.
