## What is disability?
Disability is defined as "a mismatch in interaction between the features of a person's body and the features of the environment in which they live."

There are many different types of disabilities, including vision, hearing, speech, mobility, learning, and neurodiversity. How a person uses technology is dependent on a variety of factors including the person, their environment, and their goals. For example, while one person with low vision may use Magnifier to access technology, another person may use Narrator. Other people may prefer tools like Quiet Hours and Focus Assist to better concentrate on a specific task. It all depends on the individual person and their needs and preferences.
