## My portafolio
Within this repository you will find a portfolio template ready for you to add your projects and your social networks. It is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# !!!!!!!!inserta imagen de como se ve la pagina

1.  The first thing you should do is to clone this repository to your device.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/abrildur/A11y.git
```
2.  In Visual Studio Code, after cloning the repository on your device, you will see the following files and folders (in the image below, the files marked in green-limon box). Here are the editable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that you can customize.

3. Personalize your website! This will be your portfolio, so you may use any image, style, type of text, or color you choose ❤️🎨✒️️. 

## I've already customized my portfolio, **so what's the next challenge?**.

- Please make sure the **_index.html and portfolio.html** files are implementing the **[Semantic HTML](./HTMLSemantico.md)** correctly, and where necessary, apply the **[ARIA states and properties](./Aria.md)**.
- Use the [Accessibility Design Tips](./Pautas.md) we shared with you at the beginning of this journey.
-  Make sure the content can be seen by everyone _(don't forget that there are some people who are color blind)_.
    -  In case you want to change the color, font type, or font size, you can do it in the file _portfolio-template/css/index.css_
    -   There is a tool ["Accessible color palette builder"](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/) that can be used to create an accessible color palette, which is very useful for designers and devs to know what colors are accessible to everyone.
  -  Don't forget to add _alt_ to your photos and videos.

## I have finished designing and implementing accessible elements to my portfolio, now how do I upload my website to the cloud?

This is very simple, my dear Padawan. We will walk you through the steps to upload your website to the cloud using your Azure account. 

> If you don't have an Azure account yet and you are a student, it's your time to shine and create an account with your university email [click here](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-mx/free/students/).

First, you need to download this extension in your Visual Studio code: [Azure Static Web Apps extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps).

 ### How can I download the Azure Static Web App extension?
A Static Web App is built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other technologies, allowing the user to post their portfolios and other websites to the internet quickly. 

With this extension installed on your Visual Studio Code we can upload your code from VSCode to the Azure cloud. Follow the steps below to download this important extension.

<br/>

![How to download the Azure Static Web App Step-by-Step Image's](../img/extension2.png)
 1. In your Visual Studio Code, click on this icon shown in the image above (red box, near circle #1).
 2. In the browser (orange rectangle) type and search for "Azure Static Web App".
 3. Click on the icon that looks like the one in the image (yellow rectangle).
 4. In a window similar to the one shown in the image, click on install (green rectangle) to complete the installation.

Now you are ready to upload your website to the cloud!
